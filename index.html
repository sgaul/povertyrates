        <h2>Poverty indicators</h2>
<p>Three related poverty indicators will be covered here:</p>

<ul>
<li>% of persons below poverty line</li>
<li>% of persons below 200% of poverty line</li>
<li>% of children below poverty line
All three were among the most highly-ranked indicators in the survey. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Data and limitations</h2>

<p>The measurement of poverty is complex and there are several approaches and much research <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/about/overview/measure.html">on this subject</a>. For a user-friendly introduction, NPR&#39;s Planet Money had <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/08/27/214822459/a-college-kid-a-single-mom-and-the-problem-with-the-poverty-line">some recent</a> <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/09/16/223086399/the-poverty-rate-ignores-programs-that-fight-poverty">programs</a> on this.</p>

<p>In most cases, indicator systems rely on data from the U.S. Census Bureau, generally from either the decennial census, the annual American Community Survey updates or the Current Population Survey. </p>

<p>Use of census data creates some difficulties. Reliance on the decennial census means using poverty data that is produced only once each decade. More frequent updates rely on sample surveys though, which means there can be large margins of error for small geographies. In practice, for the Hartford region this generally means towns in the region need <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/methodology/sample_size_and_data_quality/Community%20Survey">at least three and often five-years of data to create reliable estimates</a>. In other words, <a href="http://ctdata.org/communityprofile-Vernon">2011 poverty data for Vernon</a> reflects five-years of rolling surveys (2006 - 2010 or 2007 - 2011) of individuals in that town. </p>

<p>Other demographic issues, like a <a href="http://blogs.census.gov/2013/07/29/when-off-campus-college-students-are-excluded-poverty-rates-fall-in-many-college-towns/">large off-campus student population</a>, can effect the results for some towns. Data on Mansfield is particularly affected by this in Connecticut, although the impact is not large for other towns. </p>

<p>Serveral alternative measures of poverty are available - the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/povmeas/methodology/supplemental/research.html">supplemental poverty measure</a>, <a href="http://www.ophi.org.uk/policy/multidimensional-poverty-index/">multi-dimensional poverty index</a> - but generally not with the level of detail or frequency typically used in indicators projects. New York City&#39;s Center for Economic Opportunity creates <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/ceo/downloads/pdf/ceo_poverty_measure_2005_2011.pdf">their own poverty measure</a> for the city to reflect cost of living and benefits payments. The inclusion of these factors starts to move the poverty rate closer to self-sufficiency calculations, such as in the <a href="http://ctpcsw.com/basic-economic-security-tables/">Connecticut BEST tables</a> or in the <a href="http://www.unitedwaynnj.org/documents/UWNNJ_ALICE%20Report_FINAL2012.pdf">ALICE report</a> from the United Way of Northern New Jersey. </p>

<h2>What do we already know?</h2>

<p>Below are references for some local, regional and national reports that use poverty rate indicators above, with some details on how the data is used. Poverty is referenced in many indicators reports and systems and the list below is far from comprehensive.</p>

<h2>Sample results</h2>

<p>For the Hartford region, the following is some sample data for the main indicators. (Some of the following only show the 29 towns in the Foundation&#39;s catchment, but could be expanded easily.)</p>

<p>We can look at poverty rates for individual towns in the region. (The Census Bureau calculations changed in 1970 so earlier data is excluded.)</p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-1.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1"> </p>

<p>The additional poverty measures are closely correlated with the poverty rate (the percent living under 100% of the federal poverty line), although the levels for each tell a different story. </p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-2.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2"> </p>

<p>We can also convert poverty rates to look at the number of people living in poverty. </p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-3.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3"> </p>

<p>Number of people in poverty by type of town</p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-4.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4"> </p>

<p>How does the City of Hartford compare to other similar cities? The resurgent cities report provides a benchmark set of cities for this indicator: </p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-5.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5"> </p>

<p>If we combine poverty with other factors, such as long-term population changes, we can identify cities in similar circumstances: </p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-6.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6"> </p>

<p>Poverty data is released with several demographic breakouts (age, race / ethnicity, nativitiy, etc.) although the smaller the subgroup the higher the margin of error for the estimates. </p>

<p>Poverty data is also released by census tract, meaning that we can look at poverty rates within towns. The maps below display poverty rates for census tracts in Hartford and Tolland counties, for the most recent ACS data (2011 5-year estimates). </p>

<pre><code>## Testing geography item 1: Tract *, Hartford County, Connecticut .... OK.
## Testing geography item 2: Tract *, Tolland County, Connecticut .... OK.
</code></pre>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-7.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-7"> </p>

<p>Here is another view of the same data, with a different way of coloring the same map. </p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-8.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-8"> </p>

<p>Similar maps could be produced for the other poverty measures currently available or with demographic breakouts. Brookings and others have looked at &#39;concentrated poverty&#39; measures and identified areas of concentrated or racially concentrated poverty (generally based on combined thresholds for poverty and racial segregation). </p>
